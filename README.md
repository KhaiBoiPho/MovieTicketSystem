# Movie Ticket System - Spring Boot Project

This project is a movie ticket booking system implemented using **Spring Boot**. The system is designed to handle concurrent requests using **Java concurrency** features such as synchronization, locks, and thread management. The application provides functionalities for movie management, seat selection, ticket booking, and payment (optional).

## Project Overview

The Movie Ticket System allows users to:

* View available movies and showtimes.
* Select seats for booking.
* View available seats in real-time to avoid double booking.
* Cancel a booking and release the seat.

This system utilizes Java's concurrency features to handle multiple booking requests from customers simultaneously without data inconsistencies such as double booking.

## Features

1. **Movie and ShowTime Management** (Optional):

   * Manage a list of available movies and showtimes.
   * Admins can add, delete, or update movie and showtime details.

2. **Seat Selection and Ticket Booking**:

   * Customers can choose a movie, select a showtime (optional), and pick available seats.
   * The system ensures that no seat is sold twice concurrently.

3. **Ticket Payment and Confirmation** (Optional):

   * Customers can pay for tickets after selecting seats.
   * The system confirms booking success or failure based on seat availability.

4. **Seat Status Management**:

   * Customers can cancel a booking and free up the seat for other users.
   * Changes to seat status (booked or cancelled) are synchronized to prevent race conditions.

## Technologies Used

* **Java 17.0.14+7-Ubuntu-124.04**
* **Spring Boot**: For building the web application.
* **Maven**: Apache Maven 3.8.7.
* **Thymeleaf**: For rendering dynamic web pages.
* **Spring Web**: For building the web services.
* **JSP** (optional): For server-side rendering of HTML (if used).
